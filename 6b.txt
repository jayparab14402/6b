Install OpenLayers Plugin if it is not installed.
Click on Plugins  OpenLayers plugin  Add OpenStreetMap Layer.
In coordinate field at bottom of the screen enter (-8237364,4972720) and scale as 1:2500

Click on Transparency tab. We want to indicate that any black or white pixels in the image are no-data values and
 should be made transparent. Input “0” as the No data value. Also, in the Custom transparency options, click on the
 “+“ button and add 255 as the transparent pixels for each band and enter 100 as the Percent transparent. Click OK.
